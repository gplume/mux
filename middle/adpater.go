// Adapter type (it gets its name from the adapter patternâ€Šâ€”â€Šalso known as the decorator pattern)
// above is a function that both takes in and returns an http.Handler. This is the essence of the wrapper;
//we will pass in an existing http.Handler, the Adapter will adapt it, and return a new (probably wrapped) http.Handler
// for us to use in its place. So far this is not much different from just wrapping http.HandlerFunc types,
// however, now, we can instead write functions that themselves return an Adapter.
type Adapter func(http.Handler) http.Handler

// Ware is our function takes the handler you want to adapt,
// and a list of our Adapter types. The result of our Notify function
// is an acceptable Adapter. Our Adapt function will simply iterate over all adapters,
//  calling them one by one (in reverse order) in a chained manner, returning the result of the first adapter.
func Ware(h http.Handler, adapters ...Adapter) http.Handler {
	// reverse order:
	// for _, adapter := range adapters {
	// 	h = adapter(h)
	// }

	// straight order:
	for i := len(adapters) - 1; i >= 0; i-- {
		h = adapters[i](h)
	}
	return h
